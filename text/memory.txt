\f0\fs26 \cf0 To remember is\
	to keep its place near\
	and make time for it. \
	\
	Try to remember moments without a place.\
	Take pictures with a lensless camera, \
	Mail envelopes without a letter, \
	Write programs for a diskless computer, \
	Read books with no printed page, \
	Watch films without light and darkness. \
	Listen to music without a speaker. \
	\
	When you find yourself\
	Attempting to hold the setting sun with your finger tips,\
	Making maps of your mind on the sand, \
	Talking to strangers, including yourself, \
	and all the things you \
	 	\
	With the moments collected \
	Put it in a storage, \
	to keep it safe, \
	for it to fight time.}
