<b>Memory #1 </b>
</br>

<pre>	To remember is
	to keep its place near
	and make time for it. 
	
	Try to remember moments without a place.
	Take pictures with a lensless camera, 
	Mail envelopes without a letter, 
	Write programs for a diskless computer, 
	Read books with no printed page, 
	Watch films without light and darkness. 
	Listen to music without a speaker. 
	
	When you find yourself
	Attempting to hold the setting sun with your finger tips,
	Making maps of your mind on the sand, 
	Talking to strangers, including yourself,
	take a moment   
 
	With the moments collected 
	Put it in a storage, 
	to keep it safe, 
	for it to fight time.

<br>I was sitting on a rock on the hill. Writing letter to strangers. A couple, who may be visiting the city, takes a photographs of themselves in front of a beautiful tree. </br>
